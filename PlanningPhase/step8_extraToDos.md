    âœ… - list why i chose playwright over cypress, and what E2E testing is

"
Why I chose playwright for the testing framework?
My requirements I wanted to test my site were:
-testing the UI and detecting whats on the page
-interacting with the server indirectly through the webpages, not the routes directly
-multiple sessions active at once, in case i wnat to handle trading

I needed an End 2 End tester to test everything as if a user would be using the site, and narrowed it down to Playwright and Cypress.
Both were free and E2E, but unlike Cypress, Playwright had more features, and even allowed for multiple sessions at once.

- create test helpers:
    âœ… - like logging into accounts/creating sessions
    âœ… - filling in forum fields
    âœ… - and clicking buttons
    âœ… - clicking nav links
    âœ… - outline the "TestHelpers" requirements more thoroughly

    âœ… - setting text in search bar
    âœ… - setting checkmarks
    âœ… - selecting dropdown options
    âœ… - labeling things like user profile buttons
    âœ… - outline the pagnation controls test
    âœ… - create the pagnation controls test
    âœ… - break down helpers into separate scripts (checks, sets, forum filling, setups)
    âœ… - run only 1 test file w/ a short hand command
    
    âœ… - wait fors
        âœ… - wait for url to match route
        âœ… - wait for text element to be present
        âœ… - delay
        âœ… - wait until match, w/ timeout
    
    âœ… - getting element data, like is button disabled
    âœ… - navigating like going back/forward
    âœ… - getting text from elements
    âœ… - start at or go to page
    âœ… - remove the checks script
    âœ… - Account logger in function
    âœ… - hover over settings/element
    âœ… - log out function
    âœ… - fix the types not passing over in the custom Test function

    âœ… - edit profile test outline
    âœ… - edit profile data name labels
    âœ… - edit profile test
    
    âœ… - make the assumptions in the SiteEnv functions themselves
    âœ… - better errors and checking for elements
        âœ… - wrap in trycatch
        âœ… - trace stack where assumption was called
        âœ… - custom error data
    âœ… - outline the new error system
        âœ… - expectationFailed
            âœ… - trace level (1 up? 2 up?)
            âœ… - message
        âœ… - the expectation catcher
            âœ… - find if its an expectation failure
            âœ… - console.error it with the correct format
                âœ… - ðŸ›‘reason\n error line \n erroring code
        âœ… - the polling and expectors require expectationFailure errors the most
        âœ… - possibly putting all this error logic in a new script would be a good move...

- tests:
    âœ… - signup
    âœ… - login
    âœ…    -login errs
    âœ… - logout
    - navigating all the pages when signed out
    - navigating pages logged in
    âœ… - editing one's own profile
    âœ… - pagnating players
    âœ… - viewing user profiles

- refine the typescript of everything

- trade db schema object & item logic eventually

âœ… Questions or weak points:
- in a server, how to get the current route
- upon getting the current route, how to see if a route matches a route string, like /user/1234 === /user, true? so i can know to redirect it or not

Answer:
- its impossible to dynamically protect routes on the server side
- even manually listing all the routes, because the top server components like layout, have no access to what the current route is
- rerouting is done in middleware
- when middleware can't fully verify things (because the middleware can't access the database),
- then check the data in the route element, and manually redirect
