Questions or weak points:
- in a server, how to get the current route
- upon getting the current route, how to see if a route matches a route string, like /user/1234 === /user, true? so i can know to redirect it or not
- should i have a on start category somewhere with starter components/behavior?
- Request_Components
- Starter_Components (route protector & user session)
