âœ… Questions or weak points:
- in a server, how to get the current route
- upon getting the current route, how to see if a route matches a route string, like /user/1234 === /user, true? so i can know to redirect it or not

Answer:
- its impossible to dynamically protect routes on the server side
- rerouting is done in middleware
- when middleware can't fully verify things (because the middleware can't access the database),
- then check the data in the element, and manually redirect
