# Goal:
Come up with a capstone project that puts together all the fullstack skills we've learned throughout the course

# Some things we've learned are:
-MVC (model view controller) pattern
-using APIs
-saving data
-HTML, CSS, JS

# 3 project ideas:

1) Turn based combat card game

    Description: each round retrieves random character cards to fight with your opponent
    you can choose what attacks you use on your targets
    at the end of each round you get a prize for your collection

    MVC: the characters, the cards interface, how the attacks work on each target
    API: would have to be a custom API most likely, would return characters and abilities
    Save Data: statistics, collected prizes
    Real World Applications: Creating and using complex custom APIs

2) Food Akinator

    Description: you see the menu, and pick a food silently in your head
    then a series of random food images appear on the screen
    you choose how close it is to the food you were thinking of by rating it from 0% - 100%
    it will slowly try to narrow it down and find your favorite food
    (based off the genie guessing game "Akinator")

    MVC: the foods, the rating interface, the algorithm for recommending what food you're thinking of
    API: would have to be a custom API most likely, foods with traits
    Save Data: Round statistics
    Real World Applications: how to use an algorithm to determine users' preferances

3) To Do List

    Description: based on criteria, filter and recieve some to do list tasks
    you can also create your own to do list tasks, tag them, and save them to the api
    you can also search for a specific task
    there will be sorting such as, due date, difficulty, tags

    MVC: the to dos, the to do list, sorting and finding to do items
    API: would have to be a custom API most likely, would return to dos, and take in custom to dos
    Save Data: the tasks you completed
    Real World Applications: Sorting and finding a big data set



Final Chosen Idea:

Crafting Site:
- Gather Materials
- Store Materials in an inventory
- Trade with other Users
- View Inventory in sorted styles

MVC: The Mechanics/logic, the Site, the Interactions
API: The crafting and interacting routes
Save Data: Inventory Info
Real World Applications: Managing complex data from databases, and sorting them in helpful ways
